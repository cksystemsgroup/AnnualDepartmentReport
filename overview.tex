The Computational Systems Group, lead by Prof.~Christoph Kirsch, currently hosts one postdoc, four PhD students, and four masters students. Moreover, Prof.~Ana Sokolova, is associated with the group as assistant professor. The research focus of the group is on principled engineering of concurrent data structures and memory management systems and benchmarks as well as on probabilistic systems and co-algebraic structures. The group offers classes and seminars on compiler construction, operating systems, concurrency, logic, and verification.
