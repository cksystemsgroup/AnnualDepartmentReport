{\bf{Memory Management Benchmarking}}

The performance of managed programming languages is essentially determined by the performance of code execution and the performance of memory management. While there are numerous tools for benchmarking and profiling code execution there is surprisingly little support for systematic analyses of memory management. The available memory management benchmarks typically do not cover the diverse application space of modern VMs such as Google's V8, and do not allow microbenchmarking best- and worst-case behavior. Performance deficiencies in their memory management systems may therefore remain undetected during development and only be exposed later during deployment. In collaboration with Google Inc., we are working on tools that help expose the potential for improvements in memory management performance.
